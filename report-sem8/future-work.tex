\chapter{Future Work}

The current implementation handles only linear code, implementation of confluence operation to handle branching and looping is a definite work for future. Apart from this, as previously planned, experimental comparison with other algorithms can be taken up.

We used a slightly older version of GCC viz. 4.6.3 since GCC was moving to C++ as the base language in version 4.7, the current version is 4.8 and the plugin implementation can be ported for more recent versions.

We did not consider the performance of the implementation for the sake of time and focus on correctness. A quality implementation can be done and even submitted as a patch to GCC community.
