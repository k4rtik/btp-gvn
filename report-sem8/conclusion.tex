\chapter{Conclusion}

Value numbering is studied in detail and multiple known algorithms for global analysis evaluated for completeness. 
Familiarity with functionality of GCC as a compiler research infrastructure gained including some understanding of GCC source code. One of the algorithms is implemented as a dynamic plugin for linear code.

The complete goals of the project were not met due to over-optimistic estimate of time required for implementation. Lack of documentation and some difficulty faced in getting timely help added to the delay.
