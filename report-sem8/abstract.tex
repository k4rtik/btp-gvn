\begin{abstract}
	Value numbering is a compiler optimization technique to detect redundancy in expressions. We study it in detail, review and compare known algorithms, and partially implement one of the best among them. We study GCC as an implementation platform for compiler research and use it to implement the chosen algorithm to gain practical understanding.
