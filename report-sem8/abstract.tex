\begin{abstract}
	Value numbering is a compiler optimization technique to detect redundancy in expressions. We study it in detail; review and compare known algorithms; aim to implement one of the best among them, and in the process, try to improve upon the algorithm if possible. We study GCC as an implementation platform for compiler research and use it to implement the chosen algorithm to gain practical understanding.
