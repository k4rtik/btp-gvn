\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\vspace{1.0in}
I would like to express my deep gratitude to my guide \textbf{Dr Vineeth Paleri}, Professor, CSED for his invaluable help and guidance during the course of this project, and earlier for the recommendation to visit IIT Bombay for the GCC workshop which led to this project.

Many people from GCC Resource Center at IIT Bombay whom I met during the GCC workshop, especially \textbf{Prof Uday Khedkar} and \textbf{Swati Rathi}, PhD student at IITB, both of whom very patiently answered many of my emails regarding understanding of GCC concepts and code base. Prof Uday deserves special mention for allowing me to attend his workshop without charge and hence, making me promise to do a project in compilers.

Special thanks are due to my course coordinator \textbf{Ms Anu Mary Chacko}, Assistance Professor, CSED for her constant support and reschedulings when I faced difficulty with the evaluation schedules.\\[3.0cm]
