	Value numbering is a compiler optimization technique to detect redundancy in expressions. We study it in detail; review and compare known algorithms; and aim to implement one of the best among them, and in the process, improve upon the algorithm if possible. We study GCC as an implementation platform for compiler research and implement constant propagation optimization using a na\"{\i}ve approach to gain practical understanding.
