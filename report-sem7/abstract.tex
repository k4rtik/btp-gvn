	Value numbering is a compiler optimization technique to detect redundancy in expressions. We study it in detail; review and compare known algorithms; and aim to implement one of the best among them, and in the process, improve upon the algorithm if possible. We study GCC as an implementation platform for compiler research, present the chosen algorithm for implementation and select other algorithms and benchmark suites for performance comparison.
